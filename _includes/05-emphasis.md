*Red hair is a recessive genetic trait caused by a **series of mutations** in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a gene located on chromosome 16.*

**As a recessive trait it must be inherited from both parents to cause the hair to become red.** Consequently, there are far more people carrying the mutation for red hair than people actualy having red hair. 

In Scotland, approximately 13% of the population are redheads, although 40% carry at least one mutation.
